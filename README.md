# Python Analyzing Text Project
This is the Python project I submitted for my Python course through Central Michigan University. This was done using JupyterLab and returns statistical information about text from either a URL source, text file from a given path, or a string of text.

I used the following to complete this project:
1. Private attributes within the TextAnalyzer class to prevent direct access from outside the class
2. @property decorator to create getter methods for private attributes
3. NumPy, panda Series, and matplotlib to graph the most common words and character distribution of a text
4. Regular expressions
5. Docstrings to clearly document the attributes, methods, and properties of the class
6. Requests package and BeautifulSoup library to grab content from a web page and scraping it for specific content
