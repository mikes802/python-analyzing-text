# Python Analyzing Text Project
This is the Python <kbd>[project](/Mike-Analyzing-Text.ipynb)</kbd> I submitted for my Python course through Central Michigan University. This was done using JupyterLab and returns statistical information about text from either a URL source, text file from a given path, or a string of text.

I used the following to complete this project:
1. `Private attributes` within the TextAnalyzer class to prevent direct access from outside the class
2. `@property` decorator to create getter methods for private attributes
3. `NumPy`, `panda Series`, and `matplotlib` to graph the most common words and character distribution of a text
4. `Requests package` and `BeautifulSoup library` to grab content from a web page and scrape it for specific content
5. `File` objects and methods to read file contents
6. `Regular expressions` to either find words based on a certain pattern or split text into a list of words 
7. `Counter objects` from the `collections module` to list and count the elements in a list
8. `List comprehensions` to create new lists from existing sequences
9. `if-elif-else` conditional statements for flow control
10. `String slicing`, the `append` method for lists, and the `join` method for converting between the two
11. A `zip` object to pass to the `dict()` constructor to create a dictionary
12. `Docstrings` to clearly document the attributes, methods, and properties of the class and to use with `help`
