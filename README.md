# Python Analyzing Text Project
This is the Python project I submitted for my Python course through Central Michigan University. This was done using JupyterLab and returns statistical information about text from either a URL source, text file from a given path, or a string of text.

I used the following to complete this project:
1. Private attributes within the TextAnalyzer class to prevent direct access from outside the class
2. @property decorator to create getter methods for private attributes
3. NumPy, panda Series, and matplotlib to graph the most common words and character distribution of a text
4. Regular expressions to either find words based on a certain pattern or split text into a list of words
5. Docstrings to clearly document the attributes, methods, and properties of the class
6. Requests package and BeautifulSoup library to grab content from a web page and scrape it for specific content
7. List comprehensions to create new lists from existing sequences
8. Counter objects from the collections module to list and count the elements in a list
9. File objects and methods to read file contents
